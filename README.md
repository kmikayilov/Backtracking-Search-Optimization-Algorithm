# Backtracking-Search-Optimization-Algorithm

Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSA) is one the most widely used algorithms used to solve complex optimization problems. 
BSA is a type of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a metaheuristic approach to solving problems that cannot be solved with regularly used algorithms. 
The goal of EAs is to find nearoptimal solutions to the given problems. The main difference between classical optimization techniques and evolutionary algorithms is that EAs do not make sure about finding the optimum parameter values for a problem. 
On the other hand, EAs are flexible when solving different types of problems. EA tries to evolve an individual into one with a better fitness value through a “trial individual”. 
To generate a trial individual, existing individuals are chosen as raw genetic material and combined using various genetic operators. 
If the trial individual has a better fitness value than the original individual, the trial individual replaces it in the next generation population.
